Stroma
======
Stroma is a service being developed at Sir Henry Floyd Grammar School to allow students to sign in and out at breaktimes. The current system uses a clipboard where students have to write their name and the time before leaving and cross their name off the list when they return. There are many issues with this:
* There is a large queue at every break.
* Paper is required every day.
* Some students' names are illegible.
* The majority of students just don't bother.

Stroma aims to tackle these by providing mobile apps for iPhone and Android and a web app for browsers. Each student uses their school username and pin to authenticate and can sign in and out of school. The server is located on the school's network so can only be accessed while connected to the school's WiFi.
Future advancements could include:
* Geofencing in mobile apps to allow non-WiFi use.
* SMS with onsite verification code.
* QR code.
